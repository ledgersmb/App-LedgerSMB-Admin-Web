=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $db = authenticate(host => 'localhost', port => 5432, dbname => 'lsmb');

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 authenticate

This function grabs the parameters of host and port from the arg hash and the
username and password from the authentication header, and returns a db object
with a connection.  If the connection fails, it returns a 401 error.

Currently only basic auth is supported but there are plans to add krb5 auth
in the near future.

We currently return a 401 any time the db connection fails for any reason.
This is to prevent using the tool to scan for db servers for further attacks.
